The above versions are separate, isolated codebases. While the first was started from scratch, each of versions 2, 3 and 4 involved inheriting and building on repositories started by previous cohorts at Holberton School. Additionally, the work completed for each version involved collaborating and pair programming with a cohort mate - I worked with a different cohort mate for each version.

This versioning process was a great experience in pair programming and working on unfamiliar, developed codebases. Yet, it was not so great from a portfolio perspective and the want of a central, organized repository where I could show off all the work I coded and learned over the course of this clone.

This repository is just the above - an organized, cleaned up version of Holbertonbnb. Call it a minified build, if you will.
